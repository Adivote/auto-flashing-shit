# auto-flashing-shit

-n is how many video clips

-f is fps of final footage (doesnt affect time) (default is 8)

-c i how many frames from each video clips is played in a row before switching (default is 1)(SEIZURE WARNING OH GOD)

-o is outpu destination (default is just output/)

--t is temp destination uwu (default is temp/)

--fo is force overwrite, default is off, got fed up with accepting overwrites so made it auto

for example use:

python3 /Users/yarimann/Desktop/tes1/autoflicker.py -n 2 -fps 24 -c 4 --fo

and drag in ur two video files

it will definitely give u errors if the video clips arent basically the same length but its ok its a feature

depends on ffmpeg
